Adaptive noise cancellation system using deep learning
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to reduce noise in audio signals, using the MicrosoftDNS (Deep Noise Suppression) dataset. A Conv1D-LSTM hybrid model was developed to enhance bothspatial and temporal processing, effectively isolating clean audio from noisy inputs. The resultsshowed a significant improvement in audio clarity, underscoring the modelâ€™s potential for applicationsin real-world noisy environments.
